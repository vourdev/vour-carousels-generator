/**
 * Revision scoping: work out which part of a slide plan a revision request is about,
 * merge the model's answer back into the plan in code, and prove nothing else moved.
 *
 * Why this exists: a revision used to hand the model the whole plan and ask for the
 * whole plan back. Everything the user did not mention was therefore re-emitted by the
 * model on every turn, and a re-emitted field is a field that can quietly change — a
 * caption rewritten, a headline from turn 1 restored, an untouched slide's mockup
 * swapped. Nothing detected it, because the new plan was simply accepted as the new
 * state. Ten revisions meant ten chances for every field in the deck to drift.
 *
 * Here the model only ever answers for the slides/fields in scope, and everything
 * outside the scope is copied from the previous state by `mergeScopedRevision`. The
 * out-of-scope fields never travel through the model at all, so they cannot drift.
 * `assertScopePreserved` then re-checks that claim against the merged result.
